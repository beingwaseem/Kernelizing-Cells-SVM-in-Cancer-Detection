# Kernelizing Cells: SVM in Cancer Detection

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Kernelizing Cells" project! This repository utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a linear kernel to detect cancer in human cell samples. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, includes records with various cell characteristics. The analysis involves training an SVM model, evaluating its performance, and extracting meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Libraries

- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

## Key Contributions

- Implementation of SVM with a linear kernel for binary cancer classification.
- In-depth exploration of dataset characteristics and feature importance.
- Utilization of key evaluation metrics, including F1-score and Jaccard score.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Machine Learning: Employing SVM for accurate cancer detection.
- Data Analysis: Uncovering hidden patterns through statistical analysis.
- Model Evaluation: Leveraging F1-score, Jaccard score, and other metrics for robust assessment.

## Achievements

- Attained a high F1-score (0.9639) and Jaccard score (0.9444) showcasing the model's efficacy.
- Unveiled insights into feature importance and intrinsic dataset patterns.

## Why this Repository

- This repository offers a comprehensive exploration of cancer detection using SVM.
- Provides detailed insights into the model, evaluation metrics, and underlying dataset patterns.
- A valuable resource for those interested in SVM, binary classification, or cancer diagnostics.
